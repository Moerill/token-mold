# v2.11.1

- fixed packaging

# v2.11

- Localization support, including german translation! Huge thanks to GitHub user @CarnVanBeck, who did _all_ the work!

# v2.10.1

- _FIX_ saving settings to break, if no adjective list was loaded before. (Happened e.g. when the set table doesn't exist anymore).

# v2.10.0

- Fixed compatibility issue with the multilevel token module. Thanks to github user @grandseiken for fixing this!
- Changed Settings from automatically saving every time a setting was changed, to prevent accidently downloading all dicts, just because on looked at the replace name setting.
- Added clarification that enabling name replacement results in about 100MB of extra memory usage for the GM. (Someone mentioned this and it catched me by surprise. I'll still look into it if there is something i can do, but i'm not sure about that.)

# v2.9

- New smaller but curated list of english adjectives. This list is designed to allow for a better narrative instead of just having a lot of random, but sometimes really unfitting, adjectives. Thanks to Reddit user u/VagabondVivant and Github user @focalmatter for providing this list.
  - This list is set to be the default for _new_ token mold users.

# v2.8.1

- Fixed error in manifest URL (which is probably harmless, but still just to be sure)

# v2.8

- _IMPORTANT_ Removed sticky templates from token mold! There is now a dedicated module for sticking stuff to tokens: ![Token Attacher by Kayelgee](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-attacher/)
- Now also overwriting the tokens actor name, on name generation.
- _FIX_ Tab content not being shown in FVTT 0.7.X
- Removed the welcome screen / popup
- _FIX_ some deprecated code used in the regenerating names function.
- Removed bundling through webpack. Now only native ESM 6 modules are used.
  - Reason: slowness when building for development, less complications for people wanting to contribute
  - Modified the dict files, to be native ESM6 modules enow instead of json files.
